# abap_test_injection
Test Injections in ABAP before release 750.

It's the same idea like the commands test-seam and test-injection in ABAP release 750.
But this class can be used in older releases like 740.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/germanysources/abap_test_injection/wiki) for further informations.
